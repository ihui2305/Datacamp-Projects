Datacamp Projects
This project examined the clinic-level data published by Dr. Semmelweis in 1859 in which he compared maternal mortality rates from before and after handwashing was instated. This project also reanalyzed hospital-level data he analyzed, where he compared mortality rates across two hospitals with different autopsy practices.
