# Datacamp-Project: Dr.-Semmelweis-and-the-Discovery-of-Handwashing

This project utilized exploratory data analysis to examine the clinic-level data published by Dr. Semmelweis in 1859 in which he compared maternal mortality rates from before and after handwashing was instated. To further test his hypothesis on handwashing effects, bootstrap analysis was used on the hospital-level data he analyzed, where he compared mortality rates across two hospitals with different autopsy practices.
